        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This addicting air fryer broccoli has charred, crispy edges and is tossed in a sweet, tangy sauce. The extra charred pieces are my favorite part! Even picky eaters will be going back for seconds. This makes an excellent accompaniment for fish or chicken, or served on top of rice.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large head broccoli, stems peeled and sliced 1/4 inch thick, florets separated</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Thai sweet chili sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine broccoli, olive oil, and soy sauce in a resealable bag and toss to coat. Set aside to allow the broccoli to soak up the oil, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 360 degrees F (182 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place broccoli in the air fryer basket and cook for 6 minutes, shaking air fryer basket halfway through. You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer. Broccoli will be crisp-tender with lightly charred edges. Add 2 to 3 minutes more of cook time if you like your broccoli more tender.</li>
            <li>Transfer broccoli to a bowl and toss with sweet chili sauce.</li>
        </ol>
